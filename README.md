# About Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). 
This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection.
If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the
middle item.Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the 
subarray reduces to zero.
